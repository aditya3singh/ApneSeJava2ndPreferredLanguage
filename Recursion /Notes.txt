What is Recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller parts of the problem.

A recursive function has two main parts:
1. Base Case- the condition to stop the recursion.
2. Recursive Case- where the function calls itself with a smaller input.

Stack Space is the memory used by your program to store function calls, local variables, return address, etc.
Each time a function (include recursion ones) is called, it's added to a call stack.
When the function returns, it's removed from the stack.
